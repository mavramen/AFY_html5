                                Alice Fong Yu Alternative School is an exemplary educational community in large part because of parent involvement. 
                                Parents volunteer in the classroom, on governing councils such as the School Site Council and Parents Association, and for 
                                school-wide special events. The commitment and leadership of parents at AFY provides a strong network of volunteers with a 
                                can-do attitude and who support the uniquely high standards of the AFY principal, teachers, and staff.
                                Parents are encouraged to volunteer. Some weekly volunteer opportunities are as follows:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Class parent</li>
                                <li> Reading in Chinese or English </li>
                                <li> Morning drop-off zone</li>
                                <li> Before or after-school tutoring</li>
                                <li> Art class assistance</li>
                                <li> Garden assistance</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                AFY offers ample special events, which are not feasible without parent volunteers. These are rewarding, memory-making endeavors 
                                for parents and their AFY children.
                            </p>

                        <p> The Alice Fong Yu Parents Association consists of a diverse group of parents whose mission is to support the AFY community primarily by raising 
                            funds for school enrichment programs, serving as a communication path between parents and staff, and coordinating parent volunteer activities at 
                            the school.<br/>
                            The AFYPA is a 501(c)(3) certified nonprofit organization[1]. The Federal Tax ID Number is: 77-0439991. All funds directly support school enrichment 
                            programs. All donations are tax deductible to the extent allowed by law.

                        <h3>Meetings</h3>
                        <p>
                            The AFYPA consists of the organization officers (President, Vice President, Treasurer, and Secretary) and approximately a dozen board members. The 
                            officers and board members are elected by the AFY parent community to represent their interests. Members are elected for two years, with approximately 
                            half of the seats open to election each year.
                        </p>

                        <div>
                            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beginning with the year 2000, each year (except 2003) the eighth grade class has made the journey to China to meet their pen 
                                pals at our sister-school in Beijing, and to shop in the bustle of Hong Kong. It's the opportunity of a lifetime 
                                for them to experience the culture firsthand and put their language skills to the ultimate test. In Beijing, the students 
                                stay in the home of a family from the sister school. This intimate experience of life in China is a fitting culmination of study of China, 
                                its language, and its culture.
